# Smart Window Climate Control System with Automated Temperature Regulation

The project aims to develop a smart temperature regulation system that can automatically open and close a window to control indoor temperature.

Outdoor and indoor temperature and humidity sensors continuously monitor environmental conditions.

An ESP32 microcontroller receives sensor readings and runs control logic to determine when the window needs to be opened or closed.

A servo motor attached to the window frame acts as the actuator to open/close the window on command.
